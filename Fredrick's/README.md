This project is a system designed for Fredrick's, an electric vehicle (EV) charging station located in Kotte. Developed using PHP and a MySQL database, it includes the following key features:

Customer Account Management:
  User sign-up and login functionalities.
  Profile management to store and update customer details.

Charging Session Tracking:
  Recording and storing details of each charging session, including start and end times, charger IDs, and session durations.
  Facilitates detailed reporting for management and user transparency.

While the frontend, optimized for mobile viewers, was developed by a peer, I focused on creating the backend system using PHP and a MySQL database.
